## About me
The first goal from which the rest follows is to become a front-end developer, and also graduate from Saratov University. I consider my strengths to be patience, perseverance and sociability. There was no experience in working as a programmer, but I will do my best to make this line different.

## Skills

## Code 
```
function shot( map, players, enemies ) {
  return [
    {
      angle: 10, // Angle in degree
      force: 95 // Shooting power( meters per second );
    }
  ];
}
```
